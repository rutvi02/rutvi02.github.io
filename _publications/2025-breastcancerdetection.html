Early detection of breast cancer significantly influences patient outcomes. 
Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (DCE-US) has shown promise in early detection by visualizing 
tumor vascularity and perfusion dynamics in real-time. This study evaluates the efficacy of DCE-US 
in distinguishing four stages of cancer progression: normal, hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
and invasive cancer, using a transgenic mouse model that mimics human breast cancer. Ultrasound burst pulses, 
while commonly used to remove unbound contrast agents, can potentially damage human tissues. Recording pre-pulse data 
before applying these pulses helps mitigate this risk, ensuring safer and more reliable measurements. A VEGFR2-targeted 
microbubble contrast agent was injected, and the analysis was conducted using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) 
focusing on pre-pulse data. Our results revealed significant p-values that statistically distinguished between all cancer 
stages, except for normal versus hyperplasia and DCIS versus invasive cancer. Additionally, by considering normal and 
hyperplasia as benign, and DCIS and invasive as malignant, we applied a non-parametric regression model to define a threshold 
differentiating benign from malignant tissues, achieving robust specificity and sensitivity metrics. These findings underscore 
the potential of NMF-enhanced DCE-US for accurate tumor characterization and early breast cancer detection, all while avoiding 
the use of harmful ultrasound burst pulses to remove unbound tracers. This approach holds significant promise for clinical applications.
